Implementation of Huffman Coding using java:

Huffman Coding also called as Huffman Encoding is a famous greedy algorithm that
is used for the lossless compression of data. It uses variable length encoding
where variable length codes are assigned to all the characters depending on how
frequently they occur in the given text.

The characters with higher frequency are assigned smaller codes and the 
characters with lower frequency are assigned comparitively larger codes.
